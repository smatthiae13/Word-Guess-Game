Homework 3 Hangman


This was my first attempt in creating a Hangman game.

I first created a Pseudocode laying out the steps, and worked my way from there adding some code, and testing along the way. I still have many bugs to flatten out, and I need to have a better grasp of the puzzle that is JavaScript. Next week I will look back on this and probably breeze through fixing it. I can't wait.
